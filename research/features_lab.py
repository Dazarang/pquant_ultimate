"""Feature laboratory -- experimental features created by the researcher.

Winning features accumulate here across iterations.
Battle-tested features get promoted to lib/features.py later.

Rules:
  - All features MUST be backward-looking (no future data).
  - Compute per stock (groupby stock_id) to avoid cross-stock contamination.
  - Return the same DataFrame with new columns added.
